    "The above chart shows the number of engaged users each week. Yammer defines engagement as having made some type of server call by interacting with the product (shown in the data as events of type “engagement”). Any point in this chart can be interpreted as “the number of users who logged at least one engagement event during the week starting on that date.”\n",

    "Before you even touch the data, come up with a list of possible causes for the dip in retention shown in the chart above. Make a list and determine the order in which you will check them. Make sure to note how you will test each hypothesis. Think carefully about the criteria you use to order them and write down the criteria as well.\n",

Note: this data is fake and was generated for the purpose of this case study. It is similar in structure to Yammer’s actual data, but for privacy and security reasons it is not real.\n",

    "    * compare event types, is there an overal suppression of events? or is it specific to one feature? \n",
    "        * overall suppression is more likely a server problem (could also be holiday, vacation, end of an ad campaign) \n",
    "        * specific feature suppression could still be a server problem but may also be explained by a feature change/deletion\n",
    "2. Major holidays or vacation:\n",
    "    * check calendar of international holidays against dip to determine if a holiday can account for some of the decrease \n",
    "    * check demographics of user base and vacation behavior, i.e. many Americans take vacation in the summer.  \n",
    "3. Feature bug, change or deletion: \n",
    "    * similar to server problem, check the event types and determine if there is suppression in a specific feature. Was this feature recently changed? \n",
    "4. Change in customer acquisition and user engagement: \n",
    "    * Look at the number of new subscriptions before and after the peak in engagement (peak - Aug 4) \n",
